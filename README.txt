When I was younger and trying to improve my English, I faced a common challenge: I often forgot the words I had learned. To solve this, I created this simple web app.
The app works by generating two random numbers and using them as indexes to search through an array of words. 
It then displays the corresponding words, helping me recall vocabulary without the need to scroll through long lists.
You can also add your own words or phrases to the list. This makes it easy to build and expand your personal vocabulary over time.
What I love most is that the app allows me to create sentences using the randomly selected wordsâ€”helping reinforce what I've learned through active recall and practice.
This tool has helped me review words more efficiently and made learning more interactive and fun.
